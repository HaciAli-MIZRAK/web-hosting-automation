# web-hosting-automation
This project is a web hosting automation system that will be created on Ubuntu 22.04 for educational purposes. It aims to create a system where we can meet our own needs as an alternative to the paid or free options available in the market (Plesk, Cpanel, Vestacp and similar systems).
